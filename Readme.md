# SRTree
This project implements a R+-Tree together with a signature-based string pruning infrastructure.

Among the implemented variants is the MHR-Tree suggested in [Spatial Approximate String Matching](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/sas.pdf).
Note that this only implements MinWiseSignatures together with an R+-Tree.
